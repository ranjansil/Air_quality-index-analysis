Introduction
Air quality is a crucial environmental indicator that affects human health, ecosystems, and the climate. The Air Quality Index (AQI) serves as a tool to gauge the cleanliness of the air and the potential health risks associated with it.
Monitoring and analyzing AQI data is vital for understanding pollution patterns and devising strategies to mitigate adverse health impacts.


Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify the severity of air quality based on various environmental attributes. 
This model aims to enable stakeholders, including public health officials and environmental agencies, to anticipate poor air quality days and take preemptive measures to protect public health.


Description
This project involves the application of advanced data analytics techniques to a dataset containing air quality measurements. The dataset has been preprocessed to ensure quality and relevancy. The analysis includes:
•	Merging and encoding categorical data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
•	Applying oversampling techniques to address class imbalance in the dataset.
•	Utilizing Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to build classification models.


Final Objective
The final objective of this project is to effectively predict the severity of air quality conditions, thereby informing timely public health advisories and environmental policies. 
The insights derived from the predictive models will also contribute to ongoing research in environmental health sciences, potentially leading to more sustainable urban planning and pollution control measures.
